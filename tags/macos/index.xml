      <title>Yabai - Tiling Window Manager for MacOS</title>

      <description>Why and how I choose to use yabai and how I configure it (skip to configurations if that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for).
The reason for me to use Tiling Window Manager on MacOS is simple:
It&amp;rsquo;s cool
MacOS default window management is so bad
I can use keyboard for everything as much as I can
Admit it or not, making it possible to keep hands on keyboard as much as possible is a way to improve your workflow efficiency - more shortcuts, faster context switching, and less time wasted on finding your cursor and clicking here and there (espcially when you have to use bluetooth mouse sometimes, yes it&amp;rsquo;s Logitech MX master and I really hate it).</description>

      <description>Managing dotfiels is one of the most common things in developers&amp;rsquo; life. And in my opinion, changes in dotfiles, especially those improvements over time, is the best self-teaching and the most rewarding experience as a dev.
